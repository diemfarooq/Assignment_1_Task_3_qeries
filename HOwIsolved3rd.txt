Steps to solve 3rd are:

we will use join command of linux to perform inner join on both the tables
	annotation.tab
	expression.tab

the query will be
SELECT * FROM annotation, expression
Where annotation.gene=expression.gene

the JOIN command of linux join files based on a field by default 1st field 
we have "gene" as the first field of annotation table as well as expression table

open terminal type in 
$ join annotation.tab expression.tab > join.tab

you will get the out put
