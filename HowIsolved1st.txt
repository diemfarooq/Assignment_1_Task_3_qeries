The query to be run on database is 
SELECT * FROM expressionn;

The database is compbiol
and table is expression

Open the terminal
Make sure sql server is running by typing at terminal
$ systemctl status mysqld

if it's active then proceed
we are the root user 

$ mysql -u root compbiol -e "SELECT * FROM expression" > expression.tab

this makes a file expression.tab with the data of expression table
which are TAB delimited
